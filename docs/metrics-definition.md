# Metrics Definition Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the key metrics that our AI-powered online bootcamp will track. These metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of the system and the effectiveness of the learning process. They will also guide our ongoing improvements to the bootcamp.

The metrics are grouped into three main categories:

1. Engagement Metrics
2. Learning Goals Metrics
3. User Feedback Metrics

## Engagement Metrics

Engagement metrics measure how actively students are participating in the course. High engagement is correlated with better learning outcomes. The engagement metrics we will track include:

- **Active Participation Rate**: The proportion of students who are actively participating in discussions, asking questions, and submitting assignments.
- **Content Interaction Rate**: The rate at which students interact with the course content, including viewing lecture materials and participating in quizzes and assignments.
- **Attendance Rate**: The proportion of students who regularly attend the scheduled activities or check-in on Discord.

## Learning Goals Metrics

Learning goals metrics measure how well students are achieving the learning objectives of the course. These metrics help us to evaluate the effectiveness of our course content and teaching methods. The learning goals metrics we will track include:

- **Assignment Completion Rate**: The rate at which students complete assignments. This metric indicates how well students are keeping up with the course material.
- **Quiz Score Average**: The average score on quizzes. This metric provides a measure of students' understanding of the course material.
- **Project Completion Rate**: The rate at which students complete the final project. This metric is a comprehensive measure of students' ability to apply the skills and knowledge they have gained during the course.

## User Feedback Metrics

User feedback metrics are based on direct feedback from students. This feedback is invaluable for identifying areas for improvement. The user feedback metrics we will track include:

- **Course Satisfaction Score**: A measure of students' overall satisfaction with the course, collected through surveys.
- **Difficulty Level Score**: A measure of students' perceived difficulty of the course, collected through surveys.
- **AI Interaction Satisfaction Score**: A measure of students' satisfaction with their interactions with the AI agents, collected through surveys.

We will use Grafana to visualize these metrics in a comprehensive dashboard, enabling us to track these metrics in real-time and to identify trends over time. The Metrics Agent will be responsible for updating these metrics regularly.
